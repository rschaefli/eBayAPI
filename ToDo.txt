- Use Docker Compose to bring up an Elasticsearch along with the node app
- Modify the node app to write the response from the eBay API to elasticsearch
- Build a UI front-end to the app
    - Expose a port in docker-compose.yml
    - Query the contents of the Elasticsearch index


Down the line:
- How to structure the data in Elasticsearch?
    - Results for different queries need to be organized somehow
- Do we want to use Elasticsearch as persistent storage, then bring up another instance to act as the searchable index?
- We will need a persistent data store for
    - User account info
    - Queries that users create
    - Management of eBay queries
    - Turning cron jobs on and off...should each query cron be running in it's own docker container?
        - This would mean the app is pretty dumb, it just dumps results to ES
        - We would need another display and interaction app which does all the UI and user interactions....but that makes sense
        - The UI app will also have to manage the running cron containers
